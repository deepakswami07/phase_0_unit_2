  1. Pseudocode

  What is the input?
  array of numbers between 0 and 100

  What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
  sting of letrer grades

  What are the steps needed to solve the problem?

  Define a method get_grade

  if average is greater than 90 or equal to, return letter grade A
  if average is greater than 80 or equal to, return letter grade B
  if average is greater than 70 or equal to, return letter grade C
  if average is greater than 60 or equal to, return letter grade D
  if average is equal to or less than 60, return letter grade F
