# U2.W6: Create a Car Class from User Stories


# I worked on this challenge with Alan Florendo


# 2. Pseudocode
=begin
    * CREATE a car class
      * CREATE initialize method with color and model as attributes
      * CREATE a distance_to_drive method(user defined distance)
      * CREATE a current_speed method(no argument)
      * CREATE orientation method(user defined orientation)
      * CREATE set_speed method(user defined speeed)
      * CREATE total_distance method(no argument)
      * CREATE action_log method(no argument)
=end

# 5. Reflection 
=begin
    Completing the bonus exercise further cemented my understanding of class, instance variables, objects and driver test.
    Finally the confusion I had with plylist regarding how objects of one class use different class methods made more sense to me.
    I also learnt to use splat, which I found be very cool.  It made a lot of sense to use for pizza toppings.  Reading the
    recommended book POOODR was alos very helpful.
